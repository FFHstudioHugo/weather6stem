V2.0.7:
- Fixed a bug with NGSS_Directional component not updating shader global values if NGSS_NO_UPDATE_ON_PLAY was enabled

V2.0.6:
- Fixed two bugs with directional shadows in Forward when Cascaded Shadows where disabled.
One with shadows opacity and the other with the shadows softness not scaling well.

V2.0.5:
- Added coherent branching compiler defines (improves speed on some APIs/platforms)
- Macro speed improvements to PCF, skipping couple of unneeded instructions (all shadows)
- Ability to stop NGSS components from updating variables or receiving updates at runtime (if no needed)
- Disabling shadows on the light will stop NGSS component from update shadows variables
- Fixed a bug where new added local lights to the scene will override existing Global Settings
- Added support to OpenGLCore (PCF Local Shadows and PCSS/PCF Directional shadows)
- Added PCSS support to GLES3.0 (Directional shadows only, Local shadows still use PCF)
- Fixed a bug with Arkit shadowprojection
- NGSS libraries has now default minimal values (to avoid shadowed screen on install)
- Fixed a rare bug with Spot light shadows on Mac (Metal API)
- Removed OrderedDitheringDir array out of function (causes compilation error in PS4)
- Removed System.Security.AccessControl and its method block code (no needed)
- Cleaned up unneeded namespaces from NGSS components
- Fixed Contact shadows leaking on top of the main camera (can now be used on multiple cameras game setup). Renamed the light property into a more generic one, if you don't see ContactShadows make sure the light property is not null.
- NGSS internal libraries can now be added directly to shaders using the #include compiler directive. Useful if you can’t install the library locally, for example cloud builds (Refer to documentation)
- Update to documentation & new video tutorial added (to reflect new changes) 

V2.0.2:
- Initial public release
